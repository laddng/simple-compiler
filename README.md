# Simple Compiler

This is a simple compiler written in Pascal, based off Jack Crenshaw's ["Let's
Build a Compiler"](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/).

### Setup

Make sure to have the Pascal compiler installed on your local machine. A free
version of the compiler can be found
[here](https://www.freepascal.org/download.html).

Once installed, compile the program with:

```shell $ fpc lib ```
